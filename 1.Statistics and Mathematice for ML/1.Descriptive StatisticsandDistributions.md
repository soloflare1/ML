### **1. Mean (Average)**

* **Use in ML:** See the “typical” value of a feature.
* **Why:** Helps in **normalization** or **filling missing values**.
* **Example:** If a column “age” has some missing values, you can fill them with the mean age.

---

### **2. Median (Middle value)**

* **Use in ML:** Useful when data has **outliers**.
* **Why:** Outliers can mess up mean; median is more **robust**.
* **Example:** Salaries: 1 person earns 1 crore, rest earn 50k. Median shows typical salary better than mean.

---

### **3. Mode (Most frequent value)**

* **Use in ML:** For **categorical data** (like colors, cities).
* **Why:** Can fill missing values or see the most common category.
* **Example:** If most people choose “blue” in a survey, that’s the mode.

---

### **4. Range (Max – Min)**

* **Use in ML:** Understand **spread** of values.
* **Why:** Helps to see if scaling is needed.
* **Example:** Feature “age” ranges 10–90 → big difference → might need scaling.

---

### **5. Variance / Standard Deviation (SD)**

* **Use in ML:** Measures how **spread out** values are.
* **Why:** Big spread → some ML models may perform poorly; also used in **z-score scaling**.
* **Example:** Heights of students: SD small → most heights similar; SD large → heights very different.

---

### **6. IQR (Interquartile Range)**

* **Use in ML:** Detect **outliers**.
* **Why:** Outliers can ruin models.
* **Example:** If most exam scores 40–60, but 1 student scored 0 → IQR helps spot this.

---

### **7. Correlation**

* **Use in ML:** Find **relationship between features**.
* **Why:** Avoid redundant features or understand patterns.
* **Example:** Height and weight usually positively correlated.
