### **1. Mean (Average)**

* **Use in ML:** See the “typical” value of a feature.
* **Why:** Helps in **normalization** or **filling missing values**.
* **Example:** If a column “age” has some missing values, you can fill them with the mean age.

---

### **2. Median (Middle value)**

* **Use in ML:** Useful when data has **outliers**.
* **Why:** Outliers can mess up mean; median is more **robust**.
* **Example:** Salaries: 1 person earns 1 crore, rest earn 50k. Median shows typical salary better than mean.

---

### **3. Mode (Most frequent value)**

* **Use in ML:** For **categorical data** (like colors, cities).
* **Why:** Can fill missing values or see the most common category.
* **Example:** If most people choose “blue” in a survey, that’s the mode.

---

### **4. Range (Max – Min)**

* **Use in ML:** Understand **spread** of values.
* **Why:** Helps to see if scaling is needed.
* **Example:** Feature “age” ranges 10–90 → big difference → might need scaling.

---

### **5. Variance / Standard Deviation (SD)**

* **Use in ML:** Measures how **spread out** values are.
* **Why:** Big spread → some ML models may perform poorly; also used in **z-score scaling**.
* **Example:** Heights of students: SD small → most heights similar; SD large → heights very different.

---

### **6. IQR (Interquartile Range)**

* **Use in ML:** Detect **outliers**.
* **Why:** Outliers can ruin models.
* **Example:** If most exam scores 40–60, but 1 student scored 0 → IQR helps spot this.

---

### **7. Correlation**

* **Use in ML:** Find **relationship between features**.
* **Why:** Avoid redundant features or understand patterns.
* **Example:** Height and weight usually positively correlated.

Ok! Let’s make **Z-score super easy**.

---

### **Z-score (Standard Score)**

**What it is:**

* Tells **how far a number is from the mean** in terms of **standard deviations**.
* Basically, it **normalizes data** so we can compare different features easily.

**Formula (super simple):**
[
Z = \frac{X - \text{mean}}{\text{SD}}
]

Where:

* (X) = your number
* mean = average of data
* SD = standard deviation


---

**Why in ML:**

1. Helps **normalize data** (so features with big numbers don’t dominate).
2. Helps **detect outliers**


Imagine a **number line**:

```
… -2SD   -1SD   Mean   +1SD   +2SD …
```

* The **middle** is the average (mean).
* Each **step** to the right = +1 SD, each step to the left = -1 SD.
* Your Z-score = **how many steps away you are from the mean**.

💡 Memory trick: Think of **Z as your “distance in steps” from the average house**.

Example:

* Mean = 50, SD = 5
* Your score = 60 → 2 steps right → Z = +2
* Your score = 45 → 1 step left → Z = -1
